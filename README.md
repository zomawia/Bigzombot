# Bigzombot

Bigzombot is a custom AI for Age of Empires 2 HD Edition on Steam.
Currently it will make a calvary-based army and attack in the Imperial age when it has enough military units. It does not cheat.

It works best with civilizations that have paladins (Franks, Persians, Huns, etc.) though it will probably work with most.
Bigzombot will try to use counter units as well.

Map settings:
- 200+ population
- Land maps
- Feudal age start
- Imperial age end
- Conquest victory


To do:
- better economy management
- implement a fast castle knight rush
- goals and timers for different strategies
- unique civilization tech/units utilization
- build a navy
- defend feudal/castle rushes more effectively
