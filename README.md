Bigzombot is a bot for Age of Empires 2 HD Edition on Steam.
It will make a calvary-based army and attack in the Imperial age when it has enough military units. It does not cheat.

It will work best on civilizations that have paladins (Franks, Persians, Huns, etc.) though it will probably work with most.
Bigzombot will try to use counter units as well.
